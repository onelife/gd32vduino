# GD32Vduino

Arduino core for GD32V MCUs.

Initially the purpose of this project is to add Linux host support for [Longduino](https://github.com/sipeed/Longduino) 
for Arduino IDE.

## Tools (GCC Compiler, OpenOCD, and etc.)
- The Windows tools are copied from [Sipeed Longduino](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LONGAN/Longduino/tools).
- The Linux tools are copied from [Sipeed platformio](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LONGAN/platformio/dl-packages) and 
repacked.
- GCC compiler is hosting in Dropbox as oversized.
